webarch homework 7 - cURL

1. What’s the diference between Yelp’s homepage compressed and uncompressed?
Answer:
To get yelp's homepage compressed file I used:
curl  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" -o compressed_yelp.html http://www.yelp.com

To get yelp's homepage uncompressed file I used:
curl -o yelp.html http://yelp.com

When Yelp's homepage is compressed it looks like a bunch of jumble stuff.

When Yelp's homepage is uncompressed it looks like a normal web page.

When I unzipped yelp's homepage compressed file, it has 2929 lines where as the original uncompressed file has 2958 lines. The section recent activities has different user content. In general though, I don't see much difference.
