1. What HTTP command is used to make the /home resource respond with your full name (including spaces), the title of the page should be the full title of this class.

GET /home?title=Web%20Architecture%20253&name=Evie%20Phan HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1

2. Use a PUT request to set the redirect target of http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki
How do you verify this change?

PUT /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-length: 34
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=http://www.leagueoflegends.com

I can veify by going to http://127.0.0.1:5000/wiki in my browser, it should redirect to leagueoflegends.com.

3. Use a POST to update the redirect target of http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/wiki to a another new location.

POST /wiki HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-length: 29
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

url=http://www.guildwars2.com


4. Update app.py to correctly return an image from http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~<USER>/server/i253
Use your browser to test
Including the Content-Type in your submission

I change this line in app.py

    # resp.headers['Content-Type'] = '...'

It should say

    resp.headers['Content-Type'] = 'image/png'
