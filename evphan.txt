Question 1)
Your experience with web archtecture. Have you written HTML before? Written Javascript? etc.

Answer 1)
My first job out of college was at a lead generation company. I was tasked with the responsibility of search engine optimization (seo). So I did very light html coding for gobankingrates.com and goinsurancerates.com, such as: marking up text, creating anchor text links, and creating meta tags for nofollows and noindex. In the process of optimizing the websites, I also helped with optimizing the websites' web architecture where I and my team planned the sitemap of the two sites, laying out the content and brainstorming the best way to optimizing the content for organic seo.

Last semester, I took a data visualization class at the ischool and was introduced to javascript. I know some very basic javascript, but not enough to do very complex programing. This semester I'm really looking forward to learning javascript and python.

Question 2)
What are your favorite features from at least 2 browsers?

Answer 2)
I like Google Chrome's book marking feature, I think that it is really cool. I like it a lot because the UX is really simple. All it takes is just one click on the star on the browser and adding the page to the folder I want and I'm done. I don't need to look very hard to find the book marking tool. I also like mozilla firefox plug in feature. I found it really helpful when I was working in seo, since I used the firebug add on very often to simulate my changes.
